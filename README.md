# 🎮 42 So_Long 🎮

Greetings, fellow adventurers! Welcome to the realm of So_Long, a captivating project from the 42 course. Embark on this coding journey, but tread carefully—face the challenges on your own before delving into my solutions, brave one!

## What is So_Long, Anyway?

So_Long is an enthralling project that immerses you in the world of 2D gaming. It's like casting spells in the realm of game development, mastering the arcane arts of graphics and interactivity! 🧙‍♂️

## Compile-it! 💻

Before compiling, check that you have the necessary components :
### For linux
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xorg libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libbsd-dev
```

### For WSL2 (Win11)
same as linux

if not working :
```powershell
wsl --update
```

### For MacOS
You may need ton install libmlx.dylib (refer to https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html#compilation-on-macos)

Summon your So_Long masterpiece with these magic commands:

- `make`: Conjure a regular enchantment. Compile that code, and you're ready for an epic gaming adventure!
- `make bonus`: Feeling daring? Add the bonus ingredients for an extra level of excitement.
- `make clean`: Banish the traces of your enchantment. A tidy workspace is a powerful workspace.
- `make fclean`: Craving a clean slate? This erases all enchantments, leaving nothing behind.
- `make debug`: Unleash the debug sorcery using gdb. Beware: It leaves behind extra mystical artifacts not handled by `make fclean`.

Navigate this mystical realm with these commands, and may your So_Long journey be legendary! 🌟🎮
